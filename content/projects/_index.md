**Company:** [YosemiteLabs](https://yosemitelabs.com)

**Role:** Tech Lead

**Key Result:** Implementing the App in Dominican Republic

**Tech used:** Python (Flask)

At YosemiteLabs, as the Tech Lead for the ongoing Scan.ly project, I've been responsible for implementing a production tracking software used by multiple clients. Scan.ly allows users to register various events such as inventory purchases, material movements, and production output. By leveraging IoT devices like scanners, label printers, and sensors, the software enables efficient data collection. Notably, I successfully installed Scan.ly and IoT devices in two tobacco factories in the Dominican Republic and a car shop in the United States. As a result, these companies can now monitor production efficiency and resource waste effectively.

During 9 months at YosemiteLabs, I worked as a Blockchain Software Engineer at Crossmint, a company focused on NFT services. My responsibilities involved optimizing the minting process on the Solana Blockchain. I achieved this by enhancing performance, integrating new blockchains, implementing features like minting compressed NFTs and on-chain verification of creators, and ensuring the service's stability for production. As a result, we significantly improved uptime to 95% (from 70% previously) and reduced API response time to an average of 10 seconds (from 30 seconds). I played a key role in making Crossmint one of the pioneering platforms to offer compressed NFTs and led the Solana mint process within the API team.

Our aim was to create an education-oriented platform that enables teachers to conduct tutoring sessions with students, resembling an Uber-like service. I managed the development team, defined the software architecture, collaborated with the security team, and contributed to backend development. We successfully delivered the software as an MVP, with over 200 tutoring sessions booked. The MVP is still in use, and we conducted a thorough security review to ensure production-ready safety across endpoints, frontend, and codebase.

This approach aimed to reduce shipping costs. My responsibilities involved implementing a Shopify integration to receive orders, integrating geolocation for routing purposes, integrating with USPS for generating shipping labels, and updating orders on Shopify.
